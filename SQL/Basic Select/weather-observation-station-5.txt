***worst case***

SELECT * FROM
(SELECT city , LENGTH(city) AS LENGTH FROM station WHERE LENGTH(city) =
(SELECT MAX(LENGTH(city)) FROM station) ORDER BY city ) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1
UNION
SELECT * FROM
(SELECT city, LENGTH(city) AS LENGTH FROM station WHERE LENGTH(city) = 
(SELECT MIN(LENGTH(city)) FROM station) ORDER BY city) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1;


***best case***

select * from (select city,length(city) FROM STATION order by length(city) asc,city asc) where ROWNUM=1;

select * from (select city,length(city) FROM STATION order by length(city) desc,city asc) where ROWNUM=1;
